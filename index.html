        <p>I honestly cannot describe what I’m feeling in this moment. Seeing you turn 21 and still being in your life to see this huge milestone is nothing short of a blessing.
        All through the 21 years of your life you have grown to become the woman that you are today, a woman that is beautiful, a woman that is kind, a woman that is loving and a woman that is God-fearing and I am proud and blessed to know this woman and to have seen you get there.
        Sherline, you are a queen and all this is basically to say Happy Birthday my love.
        Relax, it hasn’t ended there.
